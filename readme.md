To run the code:
1. Unzip the file
2. Open the build folder - cd code/build
3. Convert the run scripts to an executable - sudo chmod +x run-scripts.sh
4. Run the script - ./run-scripts.sh

The script will start an instance of a mongo database, build a docker image to run the code and start an instance of the server and an instance of the client.
